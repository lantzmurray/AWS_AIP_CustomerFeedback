[angry sigh]

I am absolutely FURIOUS with my experience. [pause] The product arrived broken - completely unusable. When I contacted customer service, they were completely unhelpful and basically told me it was my problem.

[short pause]

The refund process has been a complete nightmare. I've been waiting THREE weeks now, and still no money back. [emphasizes] I will NEVER order from this company again.

[disgusted tone]

Zero stars. Terrible experience from start to finish. Just... [pause] stay away. Save yourself the trouble.

[abrupt ending]
