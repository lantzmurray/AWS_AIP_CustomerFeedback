[angry tone]

This is a recording of my experience with this company. [pause] I need to document what happened because it's been absolutely unacceptable.

[imitating customer service call]

Customer Service: "Thank you for calling customer support, my name is Mike, how can I help you today?"

Me: "Hi Mike, I received my order yesterday, and the product arrived damaged. The box is crushed and there's a crack right through the main unit."

Customer Service: "Do you have the order number?"

Me: "Yes, it's [gives order number]. I took photos of the damage too."

Customer Service: "Let me see... [pause] Hmm, according to our system, the package was delivered successfully."

Me: "Yes, it was delivered, but it's damaged. That's why I'm calling."

Customer Service: "Well, our policy states that you need to report damage within 24 hours of delivery."

Me: "It's only been 12 hours since I received it! That's within 24 hours."

Customer Service: "Let me transfer you to our damage claims department."

[long pause]

Claims Department: "Damage claims, this is Susan speaking."

Me: "Hi Susan, I was transferred about a damaged product I received yesterday."

Claims Department: "Did you take photos?"

Me: "Yes, I have photos right here."

Claims Department: "You'll need to email those to claims@example.com with your order number."

Me: "Can't I just upload them somewhere or send them through this chat?"

Claims Department: "No, email only. We'll review within 7-10 business days."

Me: "A week and a half just to review photos? Can't you just process a replacement now?"

Claims Department: "We need to verify the damage first."

[frustrated sigh]

That was TWO weeks ago. I sent the photos immediately, and I've heard nothing back. [pause] When I called yesterday, they told me the claim was "under review" and I should wait another week.

[angry tone]

This is the WORST customer service I've ever experienced. The product arrives damaged, and they make me jump through hoops just to get a replacement. [emphasizes] It's been 15 days now, and still no resolution.

[disgusted tone]

I will NEVER order from this company again, and I'm telling everyone I know to avoid them too. This is just... [pause] unacceptable business practice.

[abrupt ending]
