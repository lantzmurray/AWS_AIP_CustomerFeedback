This has been without a doubt the worst online shopping experience I've ever had, and I feel compelled to warn others about my terrible experience with this company. From start to finish, everything that could go wrong did go wrong, and the company's response has been completely unacceptable.

When my package first arrived, I was immediately concerned by the damaged exterior box. Sure enough, upon opening it, I discovered that the product inside was broken into several pieces. The main component was cracked, and several smaller parts were completely shattered. It was clear that either inadequate packaging was used or the product was damaged before it was even shipped.

I immediately contacted customer service, hoping for a quick resolution to what should have been a straightforward issue. Instead, I was met with dismissive attitudes and unhelpful responses. The representative seemed more interested in blaming me for the damage than in actually solving the problem. They suggested I should have purchased additional shipping insurance, which was never mentioned during the ordering process.

After several frustrating exchanges, they finally agreed to process a return, but this is where the nightmare truly began. The refund process has been a bureaucratic nightmare with endless hoops to jump through. I've had to fill out multiple forms, provide numerous photos, and wait endlessly for "processing" that never seems to end. It's been weeks now, and I still haven't received my refund.

What's most infuriating is the complete lack of accountability from this company. They show no genuine interest in customer satisfaction or in resolving problems that are clearly their responsibility. I will never order from this company again and strongly advise others to look elsewhere. The stress, frustration, and financial loss simply aren't worth it.
