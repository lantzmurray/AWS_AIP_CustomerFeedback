This has been, without exaggeration, the worst online shopping experience I've had this year, and I feel it's my responsibility to warn others about this company's practices. What should have been a simple purchase turned into a complete nightmare from start to finish, with multiple failures at every step of the process.

When my package first arrived, I was immediately concerned by the damaged exterior box that looked like it had been kicked around a warehouse floor. My fears were confirmed when I opened it to discover that the product inside was broken into several pieces. The main component was cracked clean through, and several smaller parts were completely shattered. It was clear that either completely inadequate packaging was used or the product was already damaged before it was even shipped.

I immediately contacted customer service, hoping for a quick resolution to what should have been a straightforward issue. Instead, I was met with dismissive attitudes and unhelpful responses that bordered on insulting. The representative seemed more interested in blaming me for the damage than in actually solving the problem, suggesting that I should have purchased additional shipping insurance that was never mentioned during the ordering process.

After several frustrating exchanges, they finally agreed to process a return, but this is where the nightmare truly began. The refund process has been a bureaucratic nightmare with endless hoops to jump through. I've had to fill out multiple forms, provide numerous photos from every conceivable angle, and wait endlessly for "processing" that never seems to end. It's been weeks now, and I still haven't received my refund despite multiple follow-ups.

What's most infuriating is the complete lack of accountability and customer care from this company. They show no genuine interest in customer satisfaction or in resolving problems that are clearly their responsibility. I will never order from this company again and strongly advise others to look elsewhere. The stress, frustration, and financial loss simply aren't worth it.
