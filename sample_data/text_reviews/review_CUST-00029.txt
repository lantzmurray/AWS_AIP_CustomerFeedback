I feel compelled to warn others about my absolutely terrible experience with this product and company. This has been, without exaggeration, the biggest waste of money I've spent this year, and I want to save others from making the same mistake I did.

The product itself is complete garbage - it broke after literally just one use. I followed all the instructions carefully, yet the main component failed catastrophically, rendering the entire product useless. The build quality is shockingly poor, with cheap materials that feel like they were sourced from the lowest possible bidder. It's clear that absolutely no quality control went into the manufacturing process, as the product had visible defects even before I used it.

When I contacted customer service about this catastrophic failure, I was met with unhelpful, dismissive representatives who seemed more interested in blaming me for the product's failure than in actually resolving the issue. They suggested I had misused the product despite following the instructions exactly, and refused to accept any responsibility for the poor quality. Their attitude was condescending and completely unprofessional.

The return process has been an absolute nightmare from start to finish. I've been forced to jump through endless hoops, fill out countless forms, and provide excessive documentation just to get a refund for a product that was clearly defective from the moment it left the factory. The process has been intentionally complicated and time-consuming, clearly designed to frustrate customers into giving up on their refund requests.

What's most infuriating is that this company shows absolutely no accountability for selling such poor quality products. They seem to have a business model built around selling defective items and making it nearly impossible for customers to get their money back. I strongly advise everyone to stay away from this company and their products - save yourself the money, time, and frustration that I've gone through. There are plenty of reputable companies that actually stand behind their products.
